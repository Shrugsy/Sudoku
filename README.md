This project was created as a react.js exercise, bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## To run:
1. Ensure that `node` and `npm` are installed
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory in order to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Your browser should open `localhost:3000` automatically. The server can also be viewed on the local network using your IPv4 address on port 3000
